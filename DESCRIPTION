Description: Implemenation of the Isolation forest method from the paper "Isolation based Anomaly Detection" (Liu, Ting and Zhou <doi:10.1145/2133360.2133363>).
    An isolation forest measures how easy it is to isolate multivariate observations.
    Observations that can be isolated with fewer axis-aligned partitions from random
    decision trees are more likely to be anomalous.
