\item{multicore}{fit trees using the parallel package}

\item{replace_missing}{if TRUE, replaces missing factor levels with "." and missing
numeric values with the \code{sentinel} argument}

\item{sentinel}{value to use as stand-in for missing numeric values}

tree. See details for more information.}

\description{
Build an Isolation Forest of completely random trees
}
\details{
An Isolation Forest is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm. The requested
number of trees, \code{nt}, are built completely at random on a subsample of size \code{phi}.
At each node a random variable is selected. A random split is chosen from the range of that
variable. A random sample of factor levels are chosen in the case the variable is a factor.

Records from \code{X} are then filtered based on the split criterion and the tree building
begins again on the left and right subsets of the data. Tree building terminates when the
maximum depth of the tree is reached or there are 1 or fewer observations in the filtered
subset.

If \code{ncolsample} is not null, the algorithm will subsample a number of features equal
to \code{ncolsample} to construct each tree. The features are not sampled randomly, but use
an appropriate measure for the column's class. This measure is first applied to all columns.
The decreasing order is then calculated and the first \code{ncolsample} columns are taken 
from this ordering. Numeric fields are ordered using kurtosis while factors use Shannon
entropy.
